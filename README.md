Project from Odin Project JS Fundamentals course

### Description

As a compliment to Get Coding, I decided to work through some of The Odin Project. This is a product of that. To assist in learning some Javascript fundamentals, I built this Rock Paper Scissors Program. The game plays through browser alerts and the AI is based around Math.random. Each number from 1 to 3 is assigned to either rock paper or scissors. The alert prompt takes the players input and compares it against the AI choice. The winner is declared based on Rock Paper Scissors logic. The first player to get 5 wins is declared the winner.
